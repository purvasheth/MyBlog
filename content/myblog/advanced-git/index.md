Git is daunting when you get started with it. You tend to face a fear of messing up like never before. This blog series will help you fight that fear.

When we go wrong, we follow the procedure mentioned in the meme. Save our work and download a fresh copy. While this is a good "jugaad" (hack), it becomes tedious, and of course, there is a better solution.

Let's start with a simple command which will be useful in some scenarios.

### Stash

A glance at what the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub says

> Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory â€” that is, your modified tracked files and staged
> changes â€” and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time (even on a different > branch).

Right. Okay. So what does this mean? ðŸ¤”

Well, a real-world analogy would help here.

Think of stashing as placing all your valuable changes safely in a box.
When filling a box, you'll add new items on top. Similarly, changes of subsequent stashes get added on top like a stack.

We tend to cram stuff when packing.ðŸ™‚ However, everything in a stash is neatly stacked and indexed in a well-organized manner. You can pull out changes from any index without affecting the rest.

Cool. Right? ðŸ¤©

Let's look at the commands in action. I urge you to try these out on a local repo to get a better understanding. Except for git, no installations are necessary.

1. Create a folder. And a demo file with some initial text.
2. Open git bash or terminal in that folder and run `git init` in the folder to initialize a git repository.
3. Add and commit changes.

4. Time for stashing now. Add some new text in your file.

5. Run `git stash` to stash the changes.
6. Create a new file with some text and add it for git to track it.

7. Stash using `git stash save "named stash"` to save the stash with a name this time.

8. Now view a list of stashes made with guess what? ðŸ™ƒ `git stash list`.

9. Get more details of each stash with `git stash show stash{1} -p`.

10. Run `git stash apply` to apply the most recently saved changes on your working directory.

11. Changes will still be present on the stash. Run `git stash drop` to drop them. Alternately, `git stash pop` can be used to apply and drop changes using a single command.

12. Use `git stash clear` to remove all changes from the stash without applying them.

**Note:** Index can be specified as `stash@{1}` with `apply` and `drop`. By default, they operate on the most recent stash present on the top.
