description: Do you find git daunting when you have to run any command other than the common ones? Do you face a fear of messing up like never before? This blog series will help you fight that fear. This blog covers 'amend' and 'cherry-pick'
---

In this part, we will learn about *amend* and *cherry-pick*. I use *amend* almost daily. *Cherry-pick* is pretty useful and asked in interviews at times.

### Amend
Makes changes to the most recent commit.

**Caution**: Use on a **Local** commit since *amend* rewrites the history of commits. 

#### When does *amend* come to the rescue?
+ Adding files you forgot to commit
+ Removing files you commit by mistake
+ Editing the commit message

#### How does it work?

*Amend* removes the old commit and adds a new one. HEAD now points to the new commit.

Let's look at the commands in action. I urge you to try these out on a local repo to get a better understanding. Except for [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), no installations are necessary.
